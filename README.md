# Few-shot-learning-with-adversarial-reprograming-neural-net
This repository contains few shot learning with ensemble adversarial reprogramming of pretrained neural net.
Pretrained network which used in this project is resnet18. for better results, you can use a better-pretrained network like Efficient net.
For train, you should follow all codes in one script and then run.


# training
python main.py --num_epoch 100 --lr 0. --num_ensembles 10
